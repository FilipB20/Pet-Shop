Final project @ FERIT, Filip Bičanić
The objective is to evaluate the capabilities of a Large Language Model, specifically ChatGPT, in assisting with software engineering tasks.
This will be achieved by developing a webshop application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, thereby assessing the extent to which AI can be relied upon to support the development process.
